### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my github!

- 🌱 I'm a Transport, Infrastructure & Logistics engineer with work experience in IT/Data/Planning transitioning to becoming a full time data scientist.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I just moved to Berlin and finished the DataScience coding bootcamp from le Wagon

🔭 I'm currently working on the following things: 
- A League of Legends players headhunting tool
- Creating Python apps on the VIKTOR platform (see: https://www.viktor.ai/)
- Rewriting one of my past research projects about ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) perceptions.
