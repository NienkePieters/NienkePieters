### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my github!

- ðŸŒ± I'm a transport & infrastructure engineer transitioning to data science
- âš¡ Fun fact: I just moved to Berlin and finished the DataScience coding bootcamp from le Wagon

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on the following things: 
- A League of Legends players headhunting tool (final project for Le Wagon)
- Creating Python apps on the VIKTOR platform (see: https://www.viktor.ai/)
- Rewriting one of my past research projects about ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) perceptions.
